# AppSoc
This app is aiming to remove the reliance on Facebook for societies communicating with their members. We are planning to implement this the same way that [Reddit](www.reddit.com) does with a subscription system to your favorite societies just as Reddit does with its subreddits.

## What will this app do?
Allow users to create events - Only paid members will be able to create events and all events will have to be authenticated by an exec member of the society
Have a searchable system for key terms - This will allow users to find events in societies that they did not know about
Pushing to social media (Facebook, Twitter, Discord) - This is so that exec members don't have to write the same spec multiple times
Allow people to ask questions about an event publically - This will allow users to find out more information about the event
Handle anonymous complaints - This is so that exec members can't ask where the complaint came from
Provide a list of execs for each society - This way members can know who their execs are
Notifications for upcoming events - This way members will be alerted before an event starts
Questions about running an event - This way execs can check that an event has an enough interest to be run so events are only created that people want
Custom views - So that each society will look different
Authenticate paid members - So paid members can have some perks over unpaid members


## What would we like to do?
Create an iOS version - This sadly costs money every year (Â£100) to keep up so we would need funding for this
Room bookings - This would be hard as there is no public api

##FAQ
Will the app be free?
For users yes however it would be beneficial if we could get societies to pay a small amount so that we can get it on iOS. Failing that we would turn to local business to put ads on the app if that failed then we would use an add service.
Will I need to sign up?
All you will need to do is download the app, you will only need to give your name and email if you are an exec member so people can tell who you are.
I don't pay membership for societies, can I still use it?
Yes.
